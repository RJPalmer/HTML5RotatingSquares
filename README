Rotating Color Squares Using HTML5 Canvas

This project is a simple HTML5 page that displays four squares, each of which rotates through different colors. It’s a great example of using HTML and Javascript to create a visually dynamic webpage.

Demo



Features

	•	Four squares that continuously rotate through different colors.
	•	Smooth transitions between colors for a visually appealing effect.
	•	Minimalistic HTML5 and CSS3 code.

Technologies Used

	•	HTML5 for the webpage structure.
	•	CSS3 for the animations and color transitions.

Getting Started

Prerequisites

You’ll need a web browser to view the HTML page. No additional installations or dependencies are required.

Installation

	1.	Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/rotating-color-squares.git


	2.	Navigate to the project folder:

cd rotating-color-squares


	3.	Open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.

Usage

Simply open the HTML file to view the rotating squares. Feel free to adjust the colors or timing in the CSS file to customize the effect.

Code Overview

The core files in this project include:

	•	index.html - Contains the basic structure of the page.
	•	style.css - Contains the CSS animations that control the color rotation of each square.

CSS Animation Example

@keyframes colorRotate {
  0% { background-color: red; }
  25% { background-color: blue; }
  50% { background-color: green; }
  75% { background-color: yellow; }
  100% { background-color: red; }
}

Each square uses a variation of the colorRotate animation to create a staggered effect.

Customization

To change the colors or rotation speed, edit the style.css file. You can adjust the @keyframes color values or the animation-duration to create your own color scheme and timing.
